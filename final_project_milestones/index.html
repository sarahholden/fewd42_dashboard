		<h3>Description</h3>

		<p>For the final project, you'll be designing and building a website of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio. You could create: a portfolio website; a marketing website for a startup or business; or a prototype for a simple web-app. Work with your instructor and EIR's to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.</p>

		<p>We recommend you take a look at the GA Gallery for examples of past student work.</p>

		<h3>Technical Requirements:</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Use HTML to correctly structure the DOM: Use HTML5 structural elements (header, footer, nav, footer)</li>
			<li>Demonstrate a correct use of classes and IDs</li>
			<li>Use classes to identify a type of element and IDs for identifying a specific unique element on the page</li>
			<li>Select the appropriate tags to markup content</li>
			<li>Apply fonts, color and styles to elements and the page</li>
			<li>Demonstrate use of floats (or inline-block) and the box model</li>
			<li>Use JavaScript/jQuery to make pages interactive</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>Best Practices</h3>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Clean And Readable Code. The instructional team should be able to read and follow your code easily. Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing <div> tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices) and use of proper and consistent naming conventions.</div>

			<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Implement SEO best practices related to HTML markup, and content optimization.</li>

			<li>Avoid deprecated tags. Uses best practices and build using only supported HTML and CSS tags.</li>

		</ul>

			<h2>Milestones:</h2>
			<div class="expandable-item">
				<h3>April 11th &ndash; Milestone 1: Wireframes/Proposals</h3>
				<div class="milestone">
					<h4>Deliverable:</h4>

					<p>Descriptive overview (a couple of paragraphs) along with some drawn wireframes for what you'd like to do for your final project.</p>
					<p>In other words: using words and pictures, give us as good idea as possible what you'd like to make.</p>

					<h4>How to create your wireframes:</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>Option 1: use a tool like https://wireframe.cc/ for creating wireframes. </li>
						<li>Option 2: Draw out wireframes and scan or take a picture of them</li>
						<li>Option 3: Designer? Feel free to use Photoshop/InDesign/etc. to create wireframes</li>
					</ul>

					
					<h4>Examples:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="project_proposal_1.pdf" target="_blank">Example 1</a></li>
						<li><a href="project_proposal_2.jpg" target="_blank">Example 2</a></li>
						<li><a href="project_proposal_3.pdf" target="_blank">Example 3</a></li>
						<li><a href="project_proposal_4.pdf" target="_blank">Example 4</a></li>
						<li><a href="project_proposal_5.pdf" target="_blank">Example 5</a></li>

				<h3>May 2nd &ndash; Milestone 2: HTML/CSS Draft and Pseudo Code</h3>
				<div class="milestone">
					<h4>HTML/CSS Draft:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Start writing. Don't get code freeze! Just start writing HTML. You can always go back and change it.</li>
						<li>Content can come later. I recommend using dummy text and images so you can focus on getting your HTML structure in place.
						Dummy text: Hipster Ipsum, Bacon Ipsum, Cat Ipsum
						Dummy Images: Place Kitten, https://placehold.it/ 
						</li>
						<li>Work through each section of the page and add styles and get things into place. Stick to your style guide. Not sure what to do for a nav or buttons or other pieces? Look at sites like Codrops and  Site Inspire for inspiration.</li>
						<li>I recommend https://unsplash.com/ for images. I use this site all the time!
						Keep your inspect element panel open at all times!!!</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Pseudo Code:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Work through any interactions on your page and write out detailed pseudo code for how you will tackle each interaction.</li>
						<li>A good place to start is by thinking through what events we are waiting or listening for the user to do.</li>
						<li>Each event should have a set of related instructions written out in pseudo code.</li>
						<li>Again, writing things in plain english is totally fine, but the goal here is to think through things in detail. Do I need to add a class to apply styles? Is there any logic associated (if/else)?</li>
						<li>Write this in your .js file. This will be due along with the draft for your HTML/CSS.</li>
